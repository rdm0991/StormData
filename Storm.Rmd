Synopsis: Weather variation is a significant factor for many aspects of
        any country's economic well being and it's citizen's population health 
        and safety.        
        ## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{R echo=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
library(sqldf)
library(reshape2)

setwd("C:\\Coursera\\StormData")
s.Link <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2"
download.file(s.Link, "StormData", mode="wb") 
#stormData <- read.csv(file="repData_data_stormData.csv", header=TRUE,sep=",")
stormData <- read.csv("StormData")
```

### Analysis of weather effects on population health
The population health related parameters in dataset are injuries and fatalties 
caused by the weather events.  These parameters along with event type is
extracted by subsetting the dataset.  Further an aribitrary value for injuries 
(injuries >500) and fatalities (fatalities >50) is chosen to present top events
which has direct significant effect on population health.  


```{R echo=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
healthEff <- subset(stormData, INJURIES > 0 & FATALITIES > 0)
aggHealthEff <- aggregate(cbind(INJURIES, FATALITIES) ~ EVTYPE, data=healthEff, FUN=sum)
summary(aggHealthEff)

aggHealthEffTop <- sqldf('Select EVTYPE, INJURIES, FATALITIES 
                        from aggHealthEff 
                        where INJURIES > 500 OR FATALITIES > 50
                        order by INJURIES DESC, FATALITIES DESC')
aggHealthEffTop
aggHealthEffTop.m <- melt(aggHealthEffTop, id.vars="EVTYPE")
p <- ggplot(aggHealthEffTop.m, aes(x=EVTYPE, y=value, fill=variable)) + geom_bar(stat='identity')
p <- p + xlab("Weather Events") 
p <- p + ylab("Number of Injuries/Fatalities") 
p <- p + ggtitle("Injuries and Fatalities for top weather events")
p <- p + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90, vjust=0.5, size=8))
p
